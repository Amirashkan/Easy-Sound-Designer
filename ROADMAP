## Future Plans

In the next releases, I plan to implement the following features:

- **MIDI Support**: Add full MIDI integration for controlling the synthesizer with external MIDI devices.
- **Audio Effects**: Expand the library of effects available for more sound design options.
- **Improved Performance**: Optimize the system for smoother user experience, especially in real-time performance scenarios.
- **Advanced UI/UX**: Improve user interface and interaction for a more intuitive design workflow.
